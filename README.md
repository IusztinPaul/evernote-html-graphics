# RULES
* `Do NOT use` `~!@#` `in this order`. It is used as a separator in parsing.
* A `name` ( key) should contain `only alphabet letters`
* A `value` should contain `only digits`
* It `works ONLY` for the following `titles`: Income, Needs, Wants, Investments
* The last value before those `titles` it's considered the `Total` value of the `last title`
* For now it works only with a `title` and `one level subcategories` with their `values`
